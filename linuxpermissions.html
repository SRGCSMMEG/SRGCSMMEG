        <blockquote style="text-align: justify; background-color:#D1B4A3">
          <p class="ind">Using a Linux lab with a fictional organization, I will review the file permissions for certain files and directories in the <code>projects</code> directory. The permissions will not adhere to the level of authorization required by the organization. Checking and updating permissions will help keep the system secure and will require the following tasks:</p>
        </blockquote>
      <h2>Check file and directory details</h2>
        <p class="ind">First I reviewed the current state of permissions in the <code>projects</code> directory. The below screenshot shows the command I used on the first line and then the output as a result of the command. I used the <code>ls</code> command and the <code>-la</code> option to display a listing of file contents that also returns hidden files. The output indicates there is one directory named <code>drafts</code>, one hidden file named <code>.project_x.txt</code> and four other project files. The 10-character string in the first column indicates the permissions for the directory and each file.</p>

          <figcaption>Figure 1: Current directory permissions</figcaption>
      <h2>Describe the permissions string</h2>
        <p class="ind">The permissions string is 10 characters long with the first character indicating the file type. if the character is a <code>d</code>, it is a directory. If the character is a hyphen (<code>-</code>), it's a regular file. The remaining characters indicate the permissions for the 3 distinct owner types: user, group, and other. The <strong>user</strong> type is the owner of the file, and the <strong>group</strong> type is a group the user belongs to in the company's organization. Anyone with access to the system that is not part of the group or the user belongs to the <strong>other</strong> category.</p>
        <p class="ind">Each owner type has 3 permissions turned on or off. The first being read, indicated by an <code>r</code>, meaning the owner type can read the file contents. The second is write, indicated by a <code>w</code>, meaning the owner type can make modifications to the file contents or add new files to a directory. The last permission is execute, indicated by an <code>x</code>, meaning the owner type can execute the file if it's a program or access a directory. If an owner type has a permission turned off, it will be indicated by a hyphen (<code>-</code>) instead of a letter.</p>
        <p class="ind">Using the Linux lab for an example, the line <code>-rw-rw-r-- 1 researcher2 research_team 46 Aug 30 22:04 project_t.txt</code> is in reference to the file <code>project_t.txt</code>. I know it's a regular file because the first character is a hyphen (<code>-</code>). The <strong>user</strong> permissions are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th characters (<code>rw-</code>). The <strong>group</strong> permissions are the 5th, 6th, and 7th characters (<code>rw-</code>) and match the permissions of the <strong>user</strong>. The <strong>other</strong> permissions are the last 3 characters and the <code>r--</code> indicate anyone not in the <strong>group</strong> or the <strong>user</strong> types can only read the file.</p>

          <figcaption>Figure 2: Permissions string</figcaption>
      <h2>Change file permissions</h2>
        <p class="ind">The organization determined the <strong>other</strong> owner type shouldn't have write access to any files. Upon review of the current permissions, I determined <code>project_k.txt</code> must have the write access removed for <strong>other</strong>.</p>
        <p class="ind">Using the <code>chmod</code> command to change permissions, I indicated two arguments: the first being the permissions to be changed (in this case <code>o-w</code> for <strong>other</strong> owner type minus write permissions). The second argument specifies the file to be modified, which is <code>project_k.txt</code>. To confirm the updates had been made, I used <code>ls -la</code> to output the files and directory list with permissions again.</p>

          <figcaption>Figure 3: Changing permissions with <code>chmod</code></figcaption>
      <h2>Change file permissions on a hidden file</h2>
        <p class="ind">The hidden file <code>.project_x.txt</code> had been archived and the organization did not want anyone to continue to have write access to this project. Reviewing the permissions, I determined both the <strong>user</strong> and <strong>group</strong> owner types still retained write permissions and the <strong>group</strong> did not have read permissions.</p>
        <p class="ind">While I could use minus (<code>-</code>) and plus (<code>+</code>) to remove and add permissions for each owner type as needed, I decided to use equal (<code>=</code>) to overwrite the current permissions with the correct permissions. This allowed me to complete the changes to the <strong>group</strong> type without using two separate modification arguments (<code>g-w,g+r</code>). Either way works, but the equal made the command cleaner. I used the <code>chmod</code> command with the arguments <code>u=r,g=r</code> and <code>.project_x.txt</code>. I then used the command <code>ls -la</code> to review the permissions and confirm my changes had been made.</p>

          <figcaption>Figure 4: Changing permissions on a hidden file</figcaption>
      <h2>Change directory permissions</h2>
        <p class="ind">The organization wants to restrict access to the <code>drafts</code> directory and its contents to only the owner, <code>researcher2</code>. The current permissions indicate the <strong>group</strong> has execute permissions, meaning other users in the same group as the owner <code>researcher2</code> have access to the <code>drafts</code> directory and its files. Because the user <code>researcher2</code> has all appropriate permissions, I only needed to use the <code>chmod</code> command to remove the <strong>group</strong> owner type’s permission.</p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p class="ind">In a scenario where a fictional organization needed a review of the level of authorizations of files and directories in the <code>projects</code> directory to ensure they met requirements set by the organization’s standards, I needed to modify multiple permissions. The first step was using <code>ls -la</code> to check the current permissions for the directory. I then used the <code>chmod</code> command multiple times to change the permissions on files and directories in the <code>projects</code> directory to match the appropriate permissions needed.</p>
