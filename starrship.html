            <p class="ind">
                What is the StarrShip? At its core it is a simple Google Meet link, available every day. It wouldn't seem like much when you first hear of it, but it can be an impactful tool with a minimal use of resources. Since its inception I have seen products created to imitate the concept, but nothing as easy to implement as a simple meeting link.
            </p>
            <p class="ind">
                My work calendar has a Google Meet scheduled every day during my working hours (set to free time to avoid issues with DND settings in project management and communication tools like Slack). If I am not in another meeting, on a call with a client, or otherwise focused, I can be found available in the StarrShip. Playfully named, it is a place where anyone in the company is welcome to come and go as they please. I may be sitting in silence, or playing Lo-Fi music, or taking a mental break with a quick puzzle. Those who join may need answers to a question or a potential solution to a problem, but often they just need the company. People can feel disconnected working remotely, and that can make it hard to focus on their work. By providing my presence, I helped others feel supported and productive.

                StarrShip became so popular at Elemy that I didn't even need to be available! People would come and go throughout the day, checking in with whomever had jumped on. Soon other managers were either copying the StarrShip for their own teams, joining my Ship to help or be helped, or encouraging their teams to seek the Ship out as a resource. At its apex, the StarrShip at Elemy would see Case Managers, BCBAs, Market Leads, Regional Managers, and the occasional VP level executive make an appearance.

               <strong>In November 2021, four months after I joined Elemy, I was recognized by my peers for my leadership, mentoring mindset, and contributions to employee engagement. The StarrShip was named as a key factor for employee engagement and satisfaction. The collaboration made possible in the relaxed atmosphere of the StarrShip lead to my team doubling client capacity while decreasing inefficiencies in process.</strong>

            <h2 style="text-align: center; color: #99B5D2;">Productivity Without Gamification</h2>
            <p class="ind">
                What makes the StarrShip different than using a virtual space? As working remotely has become more popular, virtual spaces like Gather Town, Flow Club, and Sococo provide features my simple Ship cannot. There are beautiful graphics, social media options, and a greater community feeling. They also utilize a lot of resources, often allow employees to work alongside people outside of the organization, and may not have accessibility features needed by employees. Don't get me wrong, they are great products, especially for tech savvy employees who respond to mundane tasks being gamified to encourage engagement. But they can also become a distraction as employees explore the functions and customization features.
            </p>
            <h2 style="text-align: center; color: #99B5D2;">Simple, Clean, Productivity Machine</h2>
            <p class="ind">
                Utilized wisely, the StarrShip can keep employees on task and encourage collaboration on a level that tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams doesn't seem to match. It doesn't distract or overwhelm like virtual spaces can do. At times it can make a team feel as if they sit at the same table, equal and engaged, while they focus on efficient and productive labor. In its simplicity, it gets the job done of getting the job done.
