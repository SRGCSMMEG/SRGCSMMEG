                <p class="ind">My role is as a cybersecurity analyst working for a multimedia company that offers web design services, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions to small businesses The organization recently experienced a DDoS attack, which compromised the internal network for two hours until it was resolved. During the attack, the organization's network services suddenly stopped responding due to an incoming flood of ICMP packets. Normal internal network traffic could not access any network resources. The incident management team responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, stopping all non-critical network services offline, and restoring critical network services.</p>
                <p class="ind">The company's cybersecurity team investigated the security event and found a malicious actor had sent a flood of ICMP pings into the company's network through an unconfigured firewall. This vulnerability allowed the malicious attacker to overwhelm the company's network through a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.</p>
                <p class="ind">As a cybersecurity analyst, I am tasked with using this security event to create a plan to improve the company’s network security, following the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). I will use the CSF to help navigate through the different steps of analyzing this cybersecurity incident and integrate my analysis into a general security strategy</p>
